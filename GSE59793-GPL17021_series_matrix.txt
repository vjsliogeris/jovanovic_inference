The mRNA was chemically fragmented into ~80-nt-long fragments using RNA fragmentation reagent (Ambion), followed by Turbo DNAse treatment (Ambion). Strand-specific RNA-seq libraries were generated as previously described (Engreitz et al., Science, 2013). Briefly, RNA was first subjected to FastAP Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase (Thermo Scientific), followed by a 3’ ligation of an RNA adapter using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs). Ligated RNA was reverse transcribed using AffinityScript Multiple Temperature Reverse Transcriptase (Agilent), and the cDNA was subjected to a 3’ ligation with a second adapter using T4 ligase. The single-stranded cDNA product was then amplified for 9- to 14 cycles in a PCR reaction. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 generating 30bp paired-end reads."
