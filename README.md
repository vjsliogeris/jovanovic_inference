Implementation of the inference from the specific dataset presented by Jovanovic.
May not be universal.
May be written poorly.
Will need a seperate environment to infer/run the thing, which is also not as extensive as one would want.
Environment is [here](https://github.com/vjsliogeris/gym-PBN).

Read this with a big grain of salt.
