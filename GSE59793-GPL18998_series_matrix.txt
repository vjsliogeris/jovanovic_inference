The peptide mixtures were fractionated by Strong Cation Exchange (SCX) using StageTips as previously described (8) with slight modifications. Briefly, one StageTip was prepared per sample by 3 SCX discs (3M, #2251) topped with 2 C18 discs (3M, #2215). The packed StageTips were first washed with 100µl methanol and then with 100 µl 80% acetonitrile and 0.5% acetic acid. Afterwards they were equilibrated by 100µl 0.5% acetic acid and the sample was loaded onto the discs. The sample was transeluted from the C18 discs to the SCX discs by applying 100µl 80% acetonitrile; 0.5% acetic acid, which was followed by 6 stepwise elutions and collections of the peptide mix from the SCX discs. The first fraction was eluted with 50µl 50mM NH4AcO; 20% MeCN (pH 4.1, adjusted with acetic acid), the second with 50µl 50mM NH4AcO; 20% MeCN (pH 5 4.8, adjusted with acetic acid), the third with 50µl 50mM NH4AcO; 20% MeCN (pH 6.2, adjusted with acetic acid), the fourth with 50µl 50mM NH4AcO; 20% MeCN (pH 7.2), the fifth with 50µl 50mM NH4HCO3; 20% MeCN (pH 8.5) and the sixth with 50µ l 0.1% NH4OH; 20% MeCN (pH 9.5). 200µl of 0.5% acetic acid was added to each of the 6 fractions and they were subsequently desalted on C18 StageTips as previously described (8) and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. Peptides were reconstituted in 7µl 3% MeCN/0.1% formic acid (at an estimated concentration of 1µg/µl)."	"Light- standard and heavy/medium-labeled sample lysates were then combined in a 1:1 protein ratio (20µg each and therefore 40µg total).
